**HR Analytics: Attrition Cause & Insights Dashboard**

**Project Description**
This project aims to understand and predict employee attrition, uncovering key factors driving turnover. By analyzing employee data (demographics, job satisfaction, work-life balance, and career progression), it offers actionable insights to reduce attrition. The outcome is an interactive dashboard visualizing the root causes and trends of employee turnover.

**Objectives**
  > Identify High-Risk Groups: Analyze data to pinpoint employee segments at high risk of attrition (e.g., by age, department, or role).
  > Understand Key Drivers: Use statistical methods to find factors contributing to attrition (e.g., job satisfaction, compensation, and distance from home).
  > Predict Attrition: Build models to forecast future attrition and identify employees likely to leave.
  > Develop Retention Strategies: Recommend improvements like better work-life balance and compensation adjustments.
  > Create a Dashboard: Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for HR to explore trends and generate reports.

**Data Sources**
  > Demographics: Age, Gender, Marital Status, Education, Distance from Home.
  > Job & Performance: Department, Role, Business Travel, Tenure, Performance Ratings.
  > Compensation: Daily Rate, Salary, Stock Options.
  > Satisfaction: Work-Life Balance, Job Satisfaction, Relationship Satisfaction, Training.
  > Attrition: Exit status and related factors.

**Tools & Technologies**
  > Python: Data analysis and preprocessing.
  > Power BI: Dashboard creation.
  > Pandas: Data manipulation.
  > Scikit-Learn: Predictive modeling.

**Analysis Plan**
  > Descriptive Analysis: Explore demographics and attrition trends by department, age, and role.
  > Correlation Analysis: Identify factors most related to attrition.
  > Predictive Modeling: Use models like logistic regression to predict attrition risk.
  > Dashboard Development: Build a Power BI dashboard to visualize trends and insights.

**Expected Outcomes**
  > Attrition Insights: Identify high-risk employees and reasons for leaving.
  > Actionable Strategies: Data-driven recommendations for retention.
  > Attrition Prediction: A predictive model for employee turnover.
  > Interactive Dashboard: A tool for HR managers to monitor and act on attrition data.
